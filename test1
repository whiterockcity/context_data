Interviewer: Hi, thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. Can you start by telling me why you cook at home?

Interviewee: Sure, I love cooking at home because it's a great way for me to relax and unwind after a long day at work. Plus, it's a lot healthier and more affordable than eating out all the time.

Interviewer: That makes sense. How do you decide what to cook?

Interviewee: Well, I usually plan my meals for the week ahead of time so I don't have to worry about it every day. I like to try new recipes and experiment with different ingredients, but I also stick to some of my family's favorite dishes.

Interviewer: How often do you cook at home?

Interviewee: I cook dinner at home almost every night, but I usually only make breakfast and lunch on the weekends.

Interviewer: What do you like about cooking at home?

Interviewee: I like being in control of what goes into my meals and being able to customize them to my family's preferences. It's also a great way to spend time with my kids in the kitchen.

Interviewer: What frustrates you when you cook at home?

Interviewee: Hmm, probably when I have to use a new appliance that I'm not familiar with. I usually just try to figure it out on my own without reading the manual, which can be frustrating if it doesn't work the way I want it to.

Interviewer: Do you eat breakfast at home? Can you describe your breakfast preparation process?

Interviewee: Yes, I usually make breakfast at home on the weekends. I like to make things like pancakes or waffles, and I always have some eggs and toast.
